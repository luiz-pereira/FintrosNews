# grabity
## Get preview data from a link. Just grab it! ðŸŽ£

[og]: <http://ogp.me/>
[twitter]: <https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/markup>

Grabity looks through [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/markup) markup to get Information about a link. Its functions will return as much data as they can from the markup. If no [og] or [twitter] tags are found, it will default to the content of the <title> tag and meta description, and if either the title tag or meta description is missing, the returned property will be empty.

## Getting Started:
```
npm install grabity
```

## Usage:
It's really quite simple:
```javascript
let grabity = require("grabity");

(async () => {
  let it = await grabity.grabIt("https://github.com/e-oj/grabity");

  console.log(it);
})();
```

Should produce:
```
{
  title: 'e-oj/grabity',
  description: 'grabity - Get preview data from a link. Just grab it! ðŸŽ£',
  image: 'https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9700116?s=400&v=4',
